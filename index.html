						M-1956 Small Arms Ammunition case
					</h2>
					<p>
						Part of the M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipment system. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1956 the US Army employed several types of cartridge belts for soldiers armed with the M1 Garand, 
						BAR belts for those armed with the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, 3- and 5-cell pockets for those armed
						with sub-machine guns, a pocket for 15 round M1 Carbine and M2 magazines, and two different pockets 
						for the 30 round magazines, in addition to 2- and 3-cell grenade pouches.
					</p>
					<p>
						The M1956 Small Arms Ammunition 
						case sought to replace all of these with a pair of simple pouches capable of holding a bandoleer of M1 
						Garand clips (5 total), 2 BAR magazines, 4 30-round carbine magazines, in addition to two grenades each. 
						The equipment came at a time when the M14 Rifle was being tested, and the ammunition pouch was thus also 
						designed to hold 3 20-round M14 magazines. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The cases were 
						issued in pairs and worn at the front of the belt on either side of the buckle. Like all other M1956 
						equipment they were constructed of heavy canvas. The top flap was closed by means of a metal eyelet and 
						cloth tab closure. Early models featured a steel plate at the front both to maintain rigidity and to protect
						the ammunition. Two hand grenades of any type in the US arsenal could be attached on either side of each 
						pouch, with the spoon hooked through a web strap and another web strap with snap-closure wrapped around the
						top. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Like other pouches in the system, the ammunition pouches each attached to the web belt with a pair of 
						slide keepers and, uniquely, an adjustable length strap with a closable hook which connected to the rectangular
						hook on the suspenders, intended to keep the case upright and transfer some of the weight directly to the shoulders.

					<p>
						Besides looking super bad-ass, Snake wears his bandana low on his brow to keep the sun and his own sweat out of his eyes.  He is also seen to use his bandana as a impromptu sling for a broken arm.
					</p>
					<p>
						Snake acquired his bandana from his former mentor, The Boss, before she defected to the Soviet Union.

						Tropical Combat Jacket
					</h2>
					<p>
						In the early 1960s, the Army Utility Uniform was the standard issue field uniform.	In 1964, Army special forces in Vietnam were issued the Tropical Combat Uniform, 
						an enhanced uniform made of lighter weight fabric for tropical environments. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Snake's uniform seems to be an even further enhanced version.  In 1964, the Tropical Combat Jacket had epaulets which are not present on Snake's uniform.  These
						loops were not removed from the TCJ until 1966.  Additionally, the TCJ featured four bellow pockets on the front, whereas Snake's only has two, like the Utility
						Jacket. Snake's jacket also includes a pocket on the left shoulder which is not present in any of the uniforms of the time.
					</p>
					<h3>
						Camouflage
					</h3>
					<p>
						Uniforms in the era were primarily Olive-Drab in color.  During the Vietnam War, the Tiger Stripe pattern and later, the ERDL patterns were used.  In Metal Gear
						Solid 3, however, Snake uses a variety of real and fictional camouflage patterns from various time periods.

					<h2>
						Jungle Boots
					</h2>
					<p>
						In the early 1960s, a jungle boot incorporating most of the improvements developed since the end of World War II was issued to U.S. 
						forces personnel during the Vietnam War. In the improved boot, the upper was made of cotton canvas duck, with leather for the toe 
						and heel, and nylon reinforcements for the neck of the boot. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The new Jungle boot originally used a Vibram-type lugged composition 
						rubber sole strongly vulcanized to the leather toe and heel. Water drains (screened eyelets) were added to the canvas top near the 
						sole to quickly drain water from the inside of the boot. Removable ventilating insoles made of fused layers of Saran plastic screen, 
						first invented in 1942, were later adopted for the issue Jungle boot. The insoles trapped air which was circulated throughout the 
						interior of the boot during the act of walking; moist interior air was exchanged for outside air using the water drain eyelets.
					</p>
					<p>
						After numerous widely-reported incidents of foot injuries to U.S. forces caused by punji stake traps, issue Jungle boots were fitted with a stainless steel 
						plate inside the boot's sole to protect the wearer from punji stake traps. Later Jungle boots were given nylon canvas tops in place of cotton duck.

					<h2>
						M1961 Combat Field Pack aka Butt Pack
					</h2>
					<p>
						Part of the M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipment system.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Field Pack was a square canvas pouch, just larger than a foot square, designed to hold a single day's Meal, 
						Combat, Individual (C-Ration) as well as sparse personal implements like a shaving kit and extra socks, The bed 
						roll was attached externally. The Field Pack's placement at the rear of the pistol-belt
						led to it being referred to colloquially as the "butt pack." The first pattern featured a square top flap which 
						closed with a pair of web straps and friction buckles. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This design was modified slightly in the 1961-pattern Field 
						Pack. Common features of both including canvas construction, attachment to the pistol belt 
						with two slide keepers and a pair of eyelets at the top of the pack for attaching the individual suspenders directly
						to the pack in order to keep it upright and help distribute weight to the shoulders. Both also included a web handle
						at the top for hand-carriage, web strap along the side with eyelets for the attachment of equipment with either
						slide keepers or wire hangers, and a pair of web straps at the bottom of the pack for attaching items like the poncho 
						and poncho liner. Both also featured a clear plastic window on the inner side of the pack for inserting a card 
						with name and service number, as well as cloth-taped edges.

					<h2>
						Canteen and M1956 Canteen Cover
					</h2>
					<p>
						Part of the M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipment system.
					</p>
					<p>
						With the adoption of the M1956 equipment, the older M1910 1-quart aluminum canteen and WWII-production steel canteens remained 
						in service well into the 1960s, later replaced by a plastic variant introduced in 1962. Both were of similar dimensions and slightly
						curved to sit comfortably on the hip. 
					</p>
					<p>
						As a result the M1956 canteen cover was not fundamentally different from the earlier models with 
						the exception of the use of two slide keepers in lieu of a wire hanger and metal snaps for closure instead of lift-the-dot fasteners. 
						Constructed of heavy canvas with cloth-taped edges the M1956 canteen cover had a synthetic wool felt lining for insulation, and was 
						slightly oversized to accommodate both a canteen and the metal canteen cup in which it nested. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Typically canteen covers also demonstrate the most visible signs of age, fading easily due to continuous wetting and drying. 
						Originally a single canteen and cover was issued and worn either on the belt between the Small Arms Ammunition Case at the front and 
						the Field Pack at the rear, or mounted on the side of the Field Pack. Troops in Vietnam generally wore two or more canteens, 
						and this practice largely continued after the war, as, with the adoption of larger complementary rucksacks, 
						Entrenching Tools often migrated to attachment points on the rucksack, freeing space on the pistol belt for another canteen.

						STABO Harness

					<p>
						The STABO is an airborne military equipment for abseiling. The rig was developed at the MAC-V Recondo School in Vietnam, to allow 
						the rapid extraction of reconnaissance personnel by helicopter. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Equipped with a standard <a href="#pistolbelt" class="internal">pistol belt</a>, the harness was also designed in part to replace the M1956 / M1967 Load Carrying Suspenders. 
						The STABOs leg straps were folded up and secured by tape or rubber bands against shoulder straps until needed.

					<h3>
						M1911A1 .45 Automatic Pistol
					</h3>
					<p>
						The M1911 is a single-action, semi-automatic pistol (handgun) chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. 
						It was designed by John M. Browning, and was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces
						from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. It was widely used in World War I, World War 
						II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Its formal designation as of 1940 was Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, 
						M1911 for the original Model of 1911 or Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1 for the M1911A1, adopted in 1924. 
						The designation changed to Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1 in the Vietnam era. In total, the United States
						procured around 2.7 million M1911 and M1911A1 pistols during its service life.
					</p>
					<p>
						The M1911 is the most well-known of John Browning's designs to use the short recoil principle in its 
						basic design. Besides the pistol being widely copied itself, this operating system rose to become the 
						pre-eminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols.

						M1956 Individual Equipment Belt (Pistol Belt)
					</h2>
					<p>
						This was part of the M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipment system.
					</p>
					<p>
						The M-1956 LCE continued the traditional fighting load concept of an individual equipment belt supported 
						by individual equipment belt suspenders. It differed from previous United States military designs, however, 
						by relying on a single individual equipment belt for soldiers armed with all small arms as opposed to three 
						separate individual equipment belts; the M-1936 individual equipment belt, the M-1923 cartridge belt for the 
						Rifle, Caliber .30, M1, and the M-1937 cartridge belt for the Rifle, Caliber .30, Automatic, M1918. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The olive 
						drab U.S. Army Shade 7 cotton canvas Belt, Individual Equipment is manufactured to United States military 
						specification MIL-B-40158 and is produced in two sizes: Medium, for waists under 30-inches [FSN 8465-577-4925], 
						and Large, for waists over 30-inches [FSN 8465-577-4924]. Earlier production individual equipment belts feature 
						a horizontal canvas weave while later patterns feature a vertical weave. It is secured by means of a brass hook 
						and loop buckle and has two rows of eyelets along the top and bottom for attaching individual equipment 
						utilizing the M-1910 wire hanger. There is a center row of smaller eyelets utilized for adjusting the size of 
						the individual equipment belt.

					<p>
						Snake doesn't technically have a mullet.  His longish hair is probably the result of an overgrown buzz cut caused 
						by long missions in conditions that did not allow for proper grooming (which could also account for the <a href="#manlybeard" class="internal">manly beard</a>).  
					</p>
					<p>
						His <a class="internal" href="#bandana" >bandana</a> pulls the sides close to his head resulting in a more defined mullet-ish look.

						Throat Microphone

					<p>
						A throat microphone, also laryngophone, is a type of microphone that picks up sound directly through sensors in 
						contact with the neck. Because of this design, it is able to pick up speech in loud environments such as on a 
						motorcycle or in a night club where other types of microphones would not function well because the speech would be 
						drowned out by background noise. This type of microphone is also able to pick up whispers and works well in an 
						environment where one has to keep quiet while communicating with others at a distance such as during a covert military 
						operation. Throat microphones were also extensively used in World War II-era aircraft, and by German tank crews.

					<p>
						Snake's primary undergarment is a compression suit probably made similar to a wetsuit.  As a multi-environmental operative,
						it makes sense for snake to wear such a garment to protect him from the changing weather, especially in wetlands.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition, the snug fit would reduce muscle fatigue in a manner similar to modern compression sportswear.
